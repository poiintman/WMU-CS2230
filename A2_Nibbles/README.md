For this assignment, you will be required to write an assembly file that will return to its caller the nth nibble of a 16-bit value. Provided is a `shell.c` program and an empty `nibble.s` file inside of which you will write your code. For convenience, a `Makefile` has also been included.

Please submit your completed `nibble.s` code in an email to __trenarycs223@gmail.com__.

# Writing Assembly

[Here](http://www.ti.com/sc/docs/products/micro/msp430/userguid/as_5.pdf) is a useful listing of available instructions on the MSP430. Please note the small number of instructions is typical of a RISC architecture. For comparison, the x86 architecure has well over one thousand instructions.

This program shouldn't take more than ten instructions and you will be graded on the brevity as well as the functionality of your program.
